We have been working with Stephen Redding for the past few years and have nothing but great things to say about his work, his work ethic and him as a person. Stephen handles our phone systems and just about every computer problem we have at Echo Valley Meats. Stephen is always one phone call away whenever we need him and if he isnâ€™t able to fix our issues remotely he makes sure to stop by our office the same day our service call is placed. He is very skilled and has built multiple programs from scratch for us. We have even had customers in our office while Stephen has been here working who have asked for his contact information because he left such a great impression with them while he was here working on our systems. Stephen shows up for us whenever he is needed and excels at his job. We would recommend him over and over again.
