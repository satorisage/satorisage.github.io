As an owner of a small but growing business, we have been faced with an abundance of IT/computer related challenges over the past several years. We have been fortunate to work with Stephen Redding for multiple needs including internet security, software management/assistance, server design and set up, new computer/hardware set up, virus issues and several password recoveries. He is incredibly knowledgeable, very responsive, friendly, and works tirelessly until the problem is resolved. Stephen has been a tremendous asset for our business, and we are certain that he will be of benefit for you as well. We highly recommend him for your IT needs.
