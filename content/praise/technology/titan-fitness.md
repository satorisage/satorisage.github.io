My experience with Stephen's IT customer service has been a very positive one. He's very honest, knowledgeable and his response time when I have called for help is always fast. He either gets here promptly to fix our IT problem or talks me through a minor issue over the phone. Keeping our budget in mind, he explains options to us when there is something new to install or replace. As a manager of a mid-sized gym where I wear lots of hats, it is very reassuring to me to know that I can rely on Stephen to address our IT issues, keeping us compliant and everything IT related running smoothly.
