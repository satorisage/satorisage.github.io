We have had Stephen working on our equipment for several years now. He came highly recommended by our accountant and we can see why. He is excellent at troubleshooting and doesn't stop until he has success. He has worked on our computers, printers, and closed circuit TV system. He is very knowledgeable, polite, and respectful. We highly recommend him for any of your IT needs.
