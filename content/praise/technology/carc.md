I am pleased to write this letter of recommendation on behalf of Stephen Redding. I believe he would be a wonderful addition to any business that he is employed at or services. As the main point of contact for Stephen here at the Club, I have had the pleasure of supervising and working with Stephen for over the last couple of years. I have been repeatedly impressed with the depth and thoroughness of Stephen's knowledge and computer skills. He always goes above and beyond to fix whatever issues we may be facing. He always provides a solution to our problems. In addition, he brings a wonderful spirit of cooperation and dedication to his work that makes him an ideal colleague, one who I am sure will contribute positively to your company.
