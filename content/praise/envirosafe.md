Stephen does marvelous IT work. He works quickly and efficiently to solve the myriad of problems thrown at him. We have employed his services for several years, and he keeps improving. Stephen works on small issues like printer connections and works up to the big issues like fixing servers and QuickBooks. It is nice to be able to call and receive a timely response when things are going haywire.
