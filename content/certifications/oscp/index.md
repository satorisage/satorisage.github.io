An OSCP has demonstrated the ability to use persistence, creativity, and perceptiveness to identify vulnerabilities and execute organized attacks under tight time constraints. They can:

* Use information gathering techniques to identify and enumerate targets running various operating systems and services
* Write scripts and tools to aid in the penetration testing process
* Analyze, correct, modify, cross-compile, and port public exploit code
* Conduct remote, local privilege escalation, and client-side attacks
* Identify and exploit XSS, SQL injection, and file inclusion vulnerabilities in web applications
* Leverage tunneling techniques to pivot between networks

OSCP holders have also shown they can think outside the box while managing both time and resources.
